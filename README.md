# Lab 9 - Search
Complete the exercises in Search.h (class/function definitions - no main() function should be written).

In this lab you will implement a few Search algorithm tasks.

## Run command
`make test`

In order to test functions individually, you can use the following:
`make test try={functionName}`

For example, to try a function `printArray()` function, you can run:
`make test try=printArray` *(No spaces)*

### Demo code

You can also try your own demo code to test your class objects and methods in `demo.cpp`. To run this code, you can build and run the file, or you can simply run the command `make demo` and the project will be built and run for you.
